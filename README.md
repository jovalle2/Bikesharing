# Bikesharing

In this analysis I've taken some sample data about bike travel and using Pandas to transform the data then use Tableau to create all the visualization.
<br><br>
Using length of time of bikes chekcing for all riders then by gender. And giving a break down of each type of use and gender for each day of the week and finally showing as well a map of the are that is most traveled.
<br><br>
What I'm Creating This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present my results. I will submit the following:
<br><br>
Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
<br><br>
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
<br><br>
Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Analysis
From reviewing the most popular trip time durin ght week would be from 7-9 am when people are going to work. Bikes are more commonaly used by men and usually only taken for less than 20 minutes. The weekends are very popular for bike use.
